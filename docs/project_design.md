# 🏄‍♂️ Surf & Parking Optimization Model

## **1. Project Overview**
### **Objective:**
To develop a real-time decision-making tool that suggests the optimal surf spot based on **wave quality** and **parking availability**, helping users minimize travel and search time while maximizing surf conditions.

### **Hypothesis:**
I believe that incorporating **real-time parking data** into surf spot selection will lead to **a more efficient and enjoyable surf experience** compared to using surf conditions alone.

### **Key Questions:**
- How can we quantify and balance surf quality vs. parking ease?
- Can real-time traffic and parking congestion data predict parking availability at surf spots?
- What’s the best way to present results in a user-friendly format?

## **2. Data Sources**
### **🌊 Surf Data Sources:**
- **NOAA Buoy API** → Wave height, period, wind direction
- **Tide Predictions API** → Tidal height forecasts
- **Weather API** → Wind conditions affecting wave quality

### **🚗 Parking & Traffic Data Sources:**
- **Google Maps API** → Real-time congestion & estimated parking availability
- **City Open Data (if available)** → Parking sensor data from local municipalities
- **Historical User Data (Optional)** → Building a predictive model for parking trends

## **3. Experimental Design**
### **Control vs. Treatment Comparison:**
- **Baseline Model (Control Group):** Only considers surf conditions (wave height, period, wind, tide).
- **Enhanced Model (Treatment Group):** Incorporates parking availability into the decision-making process.

### **Metrics for Evaluation:**
- **Primary Metric:**
  - Best surf spot score (weighted ranking of surf quality vs. parking difficulty)
- **Secondary Metrics:**
  - Prediction accuracy of parking availability
  - Average time spent searching for parking (if user feedback is collected)

### **Optimization Approach:**
- **User-defined weights:** Allow surfers to select how much they prioritize surf quality vs. ease of parking.
- **Scoring Function:**

  $$\text{Score} = (w_1 \times \text{S}) - (w_2 \times (1 - \text{P}) - (w_3 \times (1 - \text{T})$$

Where:
- S = Normalized Surf Quality (0-1)
- P = Normalized Parking Difficulty (0-1)
- T = Normalized Travel Time (0-1)
- **w₁, w₂, w₃** = User defined weights that sum to 1

## **4. Technical Implementation**
### **📡 Data Collection & Processing**
- API calls to NOAA, Google Maps, Weather services
- Data cleaning & feature engineering

### **📊 Machine Learning & Prediction (Optional for Future Scaling)**
- Train a model on historical parking data to predict congestion levels
- Test models like **Random Forests, Time-Series Analysis, or Neural Networks**

### **📍 Visualization & User Interaction**
- Display best surf spot recommendations on a **Google Maps interface**
- Create a **Jupyter Notebook dashboard** for data analysis

## **6. Expected Challenges & Mitigation**
| Challenge | Potential Solution |
|-----------|-------------------|
| No real-time parking data in some cities | Use Google Maps congestion data as a proxy |
| Surf data APIs may have limits | Cache API responses to reduce calls |
| Model interpretability | Provide clear explanations of scoring weights to users |
