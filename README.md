# 🏄‍♂️ Surf & Parking Optimization Model 🚗

## **Overview**
Finding the perfect surf spot isn’t just about wave conditions—it’s also about **how long it takes to find parking**. This project aims to develop a **real-time optimization tool** that suggests the best surf location based on **wave quality, parking availability, and drive time**, helping surfers make better decisions before heading out.

## **Motivation**
As an avid surfer and ocean photographer, I often struggle with balancing **surf conditions vs. time spent searching for parking**. This project was born out of the need to make better, data-driven decisions about where and when to surf or shoot photos without losing my mind.

## **Project Goals**
✅ **Fetch real-time data** on surf conditions & parking availability  
✅ **Develop an optimization model** that balances wave quality vs. parking difficulty  
✅ **Build a decision-making tool** (visualization & recommendation system)  

## **Data Sources**
- 🌊 **Surf Data:** NOAA Buoy API, Tide Predictions, Weather API  
- 🚗 **Parking Data:** Google Maps API (congestion as a parking proxy), City Open Data (if available)  

## **Methodology**
1️⃣ **Collect real-time data** from surf & parking APIs  
2️⃣ **Process and clean the data** to extract useful features  
3️⃣ **Design an optimization model** that scores surf spots based on user preferences  
4️⃣ **Visualize results** using maps & dashboards  

## **Project Structure**

## **Contributing & Future Work**
While this project is currently personal, there’s potential for expansion into **city-wide congestion planning** or **event-based parking prediction**. If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out!
